## A technical conference in privacy and financial technology

The Monero Konferenco is an annual meeting of privacy advocates, cypherpunks,  scientists, and philosophers. The Konferenco is funded by generous donors from the Monero community, designed to disseminate scientific and technical results in privacy and financial technologies like censorship-resistant digital cash.

## Privacy is fundamental

We consider privacy to be a fundamental human right, and we acknowledge that the development of privacy technology is, for some, a matter of personal safety. We expect presenters to emphasize their contribution to privacy technology or its broader implications, to avoid contrived use-cases, and to spotlight practical security implications. Promotional presentations as a general rule will not be accepted, although topics need not be restricted to Monero in particular.

## We hope you can contribute

Whether a sponsor or a speaker, we are delighted to have your help. Come participate in our discussions, make a proposal, and help us move privacy forward one conversation at a time. A cashless society lacking basic financial privacy can not remain an open society for long.

## Media links

The Monero Konferenco will be livestreamed on the [Monero Community Workgroup channel](https://youtube.com/c/monerocommunityworkgroup). Individual talks will be uploaded after the event. More interviews and media will be available on [Monero Talk](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3Hx81QYLoEQkm3vyl4N4eQ).
