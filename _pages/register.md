## Pay with Monero

If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can send Monero to the address below. Base the conversion rate on the most recent spot price shown in [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/monero). The last 6 digits of the transaction ID (also known as the transaction hash) is the ticket reference number. Keep this number handy, because you will be asked for it when signing in at the event. If you are buying multiple tickets, make a separate transaction for each ticket.
